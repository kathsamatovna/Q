1. Time + Price Offset:
Just take the timestamp of the order and how far the order price is from the mid-price. That gives you a basic idea of when and how aggressively they place orders.


2. Time + Price Offset + Order Size:
Add the size of the order into the mix. This way you're clustering on time, aggressiveness, and how large each order is.


3. Time + Price Offset + Algo Type:
Here, include whether the algo is aggressive or non-aggressive as a categorical feature. That can help you see if aggressive and non-aggressive orders form different clusters.


4. Time + Price Offset + Instrument or Currency:
If you have different instruments or currencies, add that as a feature. That might show you if certain instruments cluster differently in terms of timing and pricing.


5. All of the Above:
You can try combining time, price offset, order size, algo type, and instrument all together. Thatâ€™s a bigger feature set, but it might reveal more nuanced patterns.



So with these sets, you can kind of mix and match and see which one gives you the clearest insights into how these orders are clustering.
