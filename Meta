Excellent — this is where your project moves from “useful exploratory clustering” to something that looks like real microstructure research or a trading-analytics deliverable.

Let’s go deep on those advanced directions — for each, I’ll explain:

1. 🧭 Purpose / intuition — what it tells you


2. ⚙️ How to do it technically (with your ST-DBSCAN outputs)


3. 📊 Example metrics or code patterns

1️⃣ Meta-clustering of clusters (“cluster the clusters”)

🧭 Purpose

Your ST-DBSCAN finds bursts of trading — each has its own stats (duration, volume, fill%, impact, etc.).
Now you can treat each burst as a data point itself and group them into behavioural archetypes — e.g.:

Meta-Cluster	Interpretation

A	short, aggressive sweeps (impact-seeking)
B	long, low-impact sequences (VWAP/POV style)
C	large but slow manual trades (voice style)


⚙️ How

1. Build a per-cluster summary dataframe cluster_summary, like:

cluster_summary = (
    df_clusters[df_clusters.cluster >= 0]
    .groupby('cluster')
    .agg(
        n_orders=('rootId','count'),
        total_qty=('grossOrdered','sum'),
        duration_s=('startTime', lambda x: (x.max()-x.min()).total_seconds()),
        price_span=('priceExecuted', lambda x: x.max()-x.min()),
        avg_fill_ratio=('grossExecuted','mean'),
        side=('dealSide','first'),
        bucket=('sizeBucket','first')
    )
)
cluster_summary['impact_slope'] = cluster_summary['price_span'] / cluster_summary['duration_s']


2. Standardise those numeric features:

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(cluster_summary[['n_orders','total_qty','duration_s','price_span','impact_slope']])


3. Apply a second-stage clustering (e.g. KMeans, GaussianMixture, or HDBSCAN):

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
cluster_summary['meta_label'] = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit_predict(X)


4. Visualise:

import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(cluster_summary, hue='meta_label', vars=['duration_s','total_qty','price_span'])



📊 What you learn

Execution styles that emerge naturally.

Whether voice vs e-trader bursts occupy different meta-clusters.

How cluster quality (silhouette) varies across meta-types.



---

2️⃣ Sequence / temporal pattern analysis

🧭 Purpose

To see if clusters form predictable temporal sequences:

Do BUY clusters tend to follow SELL clusters?

Is there autocorrelation in cluster direction, duration, or size?

Are there daily periodicities (e.g. pre-fix bursts)?


⚙️ How

1. Sort clusters by their start time (first order timestamp per cluster).

cluster_summary['start_time'] = (
    df_clusters.groupby('cluster')['startTime'].min()
)
cluster_summary = cluster_summary.sort_values('start_time')


2. Compute lag features:

cluster_summary['lag_side'] = cluster_summary['side'].shift(1)
cluster_summary['same_side_as_prev'] = (cluster_summary['side'] == cluster_summary['lag_side']).astype(int)


3. Measure autocorrelations:

cluster_summary['size_diff'] = cluster_summary['total_qty'].diff()
cluster_summary['duration_diff'] = cluster_summary['duration_s'].diff()
cluster_summary[['total_qty','duration_s']].corr()


4. Use a rolling window (e.g. 1h) to compute density of bursts over time → reveals cyclical patterns.



📊 What you learn

Memory in trader flow (e.g. sequences of same-side bursts).

Clustering in time — if bursts arrive in waves.

Volatility regime sensitivity — more bursts during high vol periods.



---

3️⃣ Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for regime inference

🧭 Purpose

Detect latent behavioural regimes:
e.g., calm algorithmic flow vs aggressive risk-transfer phase.

⚙️ How

1. Use hmmlearn or pomegranate.


2. Input time-ordered features per cluster (duration, size, side encoded ±1, impact).

from hmmlearn.hmm import GaussianHMM
X = cluster_summary[['duration_s','total_qty','impact_slope']].to_numpy()
model = GaussianHMM(n_components=3, covariance_type='full', n_iter=200).fit(X)
cluster_summary['regime'] = model.predict(X)


3. Plot regimes through time:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(cluster_summary['start_time'], cluster_summary['total_qty'], c=cluster_summary['regime'])



📊 What you learn

Distinct modes of trading behaviour.

Transition probabilities between them (how often “aggressive” → “passive”).

Useful for monitoring or automatic desk behaviour classification.



---

4️⃣ Cluster stability / robustness

🧭 Purpose

Validate that your results aren’t random artifacts of parameter tuning.

⚙️ How

1. Run ST-DBSCAN for multiple eps_space values around your chosen one.


2. Compare cluster labelings using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI):

from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score
labels_ref = df_clusters['cluster']
labels_alt = df_clusters_alt['cluster']
ari = adjusted_rand_score(labels_ref, labels_alt)
print("ARI:", ari)


3. Plot ARI vs eps_space — plateau = stable regime.



📊 What you learn

Whether your clusters reflect real density structure or parameter sensitivity.

Stability of cluster definitions across different settings or time periods.



---

5️⃣ Cross-desk / trader comparison

🧭 Purpose

If you have multiple traders, desks, or algoTypes — compare their cluster behaviour statistically.

⚙️ How

1. Compute cluster summary features per trader/algo.


2. Aggregate:

stats = (cluster_summary.groupby('traderId')
         .agg({'total_qty':'mean','duration_s':'median','impact_slope':'mean'}))


3. Test differences:

from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
ttest_ind(stats.loc[deskA,'impact_slope'], stats.loc[deskB,'impact_slope'])


4. Visualise:

sns.violinplot(data=cluster_summary, x='traderDesk', y='impact_slope')



📊 What you learn

Quantifiable desk-style differences.

Potential benchmark profiles (“our VWAP desk looks like this”).

Basis for behavioural fingerprinting.



---

6️⃣ Cross-feature correlation / causality

🧭 Purpose

Understand what drives cluster characteristics.

⚙️ How

1. Correlate cluster metrics with market context (spread, volatility, time-of-day).


2. If you have mid-price series, compute contemporaneous volatility and regress:

import statsmodels.api as sm
X = sm.add_constant(cluster_summary[['volatility','spread']])
y = cluster_summary['impact_slope']
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())


3. This quantifies how much of your cluster aggressiveness comes from market conditions.



📊 What you learn

Sensitivity of trader behaviour to market state.

Evidence for adaptive algorithmic execution.



---

7️⃣ Graph / network analysis (bonus)

🧭 Purpose

See if clusters connect via shared orders, venues, or traders.

⚙️ How

1. Build a bipartite graph (clusters ↔ traders or venues).


2. Use networkx to compute centrality:

import networkx as nx
G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df_clusters, 'cluster', 'venue')
nx.degree_centrality(G)



📊 What you learn

Structural overlaps between desks/venues.

Whether some venues concentrate certain behavioural types.



---

8️⃣ Predictive / monitoring angle

🧭 Purpose

Use features of early orders in a cluster to predict its future impact or duration.

⚙️ How

1. For each cluster, take first few orders (e.g. first 3).


2. Use early statistics (avg size, early slope) to predict full-cluster metrics with regression or ML:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor().fit(X_train, y_train)



📊 What you learn

Early warning of high-impact bursts.

Potential desk analytics / control metric.



---

9️⃣ Regime alignment with market data

🧭 Purpose

Compare trader-behaviour regimes with external regimes (volatility spikes, macro events, etc.).

⚙️ How

Overlay your HMM or meta-cluster regime series with VIX, EURUSD vol, etc.

Use correlation or event-study windows.


📊 What you learn

Whether bursts coincide with external shocks.

Behavioural adaptation to macro stress.

Would you like me to pick, say, two of these directions (HMM regimes + meta-clustering of clusters) and give you fully-worked code cells with your variable names (df_clusters, grossOrdered, priceExecuted, etc.) so you can drop them into your notebook and run straight away?
