Here's how to do this join operation in q/kdb+:

**Basic Join Syntax:**
```q
/ Left join fit table with catskill table
result: fit_table lj `timeforce xkey select from catskill_table

/ Or if you want to be more explicit about the key mapping:
result: fit_table lj ([timeforce:OrderId] from catskill_table)
```

**Step by step:**

1. **If your tables are already loaded:**
```q
/ Assuming your tables are called fit and catskill
result: fit lj `timeforce xkey catskill
```

2. **If you need to key the catskill table first:**
```q
/ Key catskill table by OrderId, then join on timeforce
catskill_keyed: `OrderId xkey catskill
result: fit lj `timeforce xcol catskill_keyed
```

3. **More explicit approach:**
```q
/ Create the lookup mapping
lookup: select timeforce:OrderId, other_cols from catskill
lookup_keyed: `timeforce xkey lookup
result: fit lj lookup_keyed
```

**Key q concepts here:**
- `lj` = left join (keeps all records from left table)
- `xkey` = sets the key column(s) 
- `xcol` = renames columns if needed

**If your column names don't match exactly:**
```q
/ Rename OrderId to timeforce in catskill, then join
catskill_renamed: `timeforce xcol `OrderId`timeforce xcols catskill
result: fit lj `timeforce xkey catskill_renamed
```

The result will give you all fit table records with matching catskill data appended where the timeforce values align with OrderId values.
