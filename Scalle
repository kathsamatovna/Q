Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre hitting a subtle but very common gotcha.
Let‚Äôs go step-by-step and make it fully plug-and-play for your notebook (with your variables like grossOrdered, priceExecuted, dealSide, etc.).

üß© What‚Äôs going wrong

When you pass scaler=StandardScaler, you‚Äôre actually passing the class, not a fitted object.
So when the code later calls scaler.transform(xy) it fails, because the class itself doesn‚Äôt have the .transform() method ‚Äî only a fitted instance does.

In other words:

scaler = StandardScaler()      # ‚úÖ create an instance
scaler.fit(X)                  # ‚úÖ fit it
scaler.transform(X)            # ‚úÖ now works

vs.

scaler = StandardScaler        # ‚ùå just the class, no methods bound

‚úÖ Correct way to handle scaling in your ST-DBSCAN

You have two clean options depending on how you want scaling to behave.


---

Option 1: Fit a scaler once per 5-minute side bucket (recommended)

This keeps each bucket self-contained, avoids cross-bucket scaling distortion, and guarantees no leaks.

from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def run_stdbscan_per_bucket(df, eps_space, eps_time_s, min_samples):
    df = df.copy()
    df['bucket5'] = df['startTime'].dt.floor('5min')
    results = []

    for (bkt, side), g in df.groupby(['bucket5', 'dealSide'], sort=False):
        if len(g) < min_samples:
            continue

        # --- fit scaler on numeric columns only
        X = g[['grossOrdered', 'priceExecuted']].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').fillna(0.0).to_numpy()
        scaler = RobustScaler().fit(X)

        # --- run ST-DBSCAN with the fitted scaler
        g_clustered = ST_DBSCAN(
            g, eps_space=eps_space, eps_time_s=eps_time_s,
            min_samples=min_samples, qty_col='grossOrdered',
            price_col='priceExecuted', side_col='dealSide',
            scaler=scaler
        )
        results.append(g_clustered)

    return pd.concat(results).sort_index()

Then call:

df_clusters = run_stdbscan_per_bucket(df, eps_space=0.8, eps_time_s=300, min_samples=5)


---

Option 2: Use a global scaler once for the entire dataset

If your quantities and prices are in similar ranges across the day (e.g., same instrument, consistent magnitude), you can scale once globally and pass that instance around.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Fit once on the whole day
X_all = df[['grossOrdered', 'priceExecuted']].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').fillna(0.0).to_numpy()
global_scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_all)

# Now run ST-DBSCAN for each bucket, reusing the same fitted scaler
df_clusters = run_stdbscan_per_bucket(df, eps_space=0.8, eps_time_s=300, min_samples=5)

Inside run_stdbscan_per_bucket, you can change it to accept scaler as an argument if you want full control.


---

Minimal inline use (for testing)

If you just want to test one group manually:

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

g = df.iloc[:200].copy()
X = g[['grossOrdered','priceExecuted']].to_numpy()
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)

df_test = ST_DBSCAN(g, eps_space=0.8, eps_time_s=300, min_samples=5,
                    qty_col='grossOrdered', price_col='priceExecuted',
                    side_col='dealSide', scaler=scaler)


---

‚öôÔ∏è Quick sanity check before clustering

Make sure the columns are numeric and have no NaNs before scaling:

df[['grossOrdered','priceExecuted']] = df[['grossOrdered','priceExecuted']].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').fillna(0.0)

Would you like me to show you exactly where to plug these 3‚Äì4 lines into your existing notebook code (using the same ST_DBSCAN and neighbors functions you already have)?
I can point to the precise cell where to initialize and pass the scaler.
