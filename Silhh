That’s an excellent question — and it’s exactly the kind of thinking that separates “I can run clustering” from “I can interpret market microstructure.”
Let’s treat this like a mini research pipeline for your order-flow clustering project, with concrete analytical directions you can pursue now that you have clusters.

🧭 Big Picture: What You Have and What It Means

Right now your ST-DBSCAN gives you:

Groups of temporally and spatially close trades (same side, similar price/size)

Per-cluster metadata: side (BUY/SELL), start time, cumulative fills, algoType, venue, etc.

Possibly bucketed by size, time-of-day, or trader type (voice vs electronic)


So each cluster ≈ a trading episode or burst of related orders.

Your next steps fall into three layers:


---

🔹 1. Descriptive analysis — “What are these clusters like?”

Start by quantifying and visualising.

A. Cluster-level features

For each cluster, compute:

Metric	Meaning / Intuition

n_orders	liquidity-taking activity intensity
total_qty, avg_qty, std_qty	execution style (blocky vs fragmented)
duration = max(startTime) – min(startTime)	aggression horizon
price_span = max(priceExecuted) – min(priceExecuted)	price tolerance
fill_ratio = grossExecuted / grossOrdered	completion efficiency
avg_interarrival_s	pacing of child orders
algoType, venue mode counts	strategy fingerprints


You can compute a cluster summary table:

cluster_summary = (
    df_clusters[df_clusters['cluster'] >= 0]
    .groupby('cluster')
    .agg(
        n_orders=('rootId','nunique'),
        total_qty=('grossOrdered','sum'),
        duration=('startTime', lambda x: x.max()-x.min()),
        price_span=('priceExecuted', lambda x: x.max()-x.min()),
        mean_fill=('grossExecuted','mean'),
        side=('dealSide','first'),
        bucket=('sizeBucket','first')
    )
    .sort_values('total_qty', ascending=False)
)

Then plot distributions (e.g. duration vs n_orders coloured by side).


---

B. Time-of-day and side asymmetries

Plot number or size of clusters over trading day: cluster_start_time.dt.hour
→ reveals when bursts occur (morning vs fix vs late day).

Compare BUY vs SELL clusters: counts, mean sizes, durations.



---

C. Size-bucket behaviour

Now that you bucket by order size, you can see:

Do large-order clusters tend to last longer or span more price levels?

Is their price_span / duration (slope) flatter — implying stealthier execution?

Are small-order clusters more short-lived or single-order (noise)?


Example:

import seaborn as sns
sns.boxplot(data=cluster_summary, x='bucket', y='duration', hue='side')


---

🔹 2. Behavioural analysis — “What could this mean about trading intent?”

Interpret the physical meaning of clusters in trading terms.

A. Execution pattern archetypes

You can label clusters into archetypes:

Pattern	Signature	Hypothesis

Aggressive sweep	short duration, high fill%, wide price span	trader wants immediacy
Passive iceberg	long duration, many small orders, low price span	trader hiding size
Algorithmic VWAP/POV	regular inter-arrival spacing, uniform size	automated schedule
Voice block	few orders, large notional	negotiated deal


You can compute metrics like:

cluster_summary['tempo'] = cluster_summary['n_orders'] / cluster_summary['duration'].dt.total_seconds()
cluster_summary['impact_per_qty'] = cluster_summary['price_span'] / cluster_summary['total_qty']

and cluster the clusters themselves (meta-clustering) into behaviour categories.


---

B. Market impact / slippage

If you have mid-price or best-bid/ask series:

1. For each cluster, compute average slippage:



\text{impact} = \frac{P_\text{exec} - P_\text{mid,start}}{P_\text{mid,start}}

→ “Are larger or faster bursts more market-moving?”

This connects your ST-DBSCAN structure to market impact studies.


---

C. Venue / algorithm interaction

You already capture algoType and catStifVenue.
You can cross-tabulate:

pd.crosstab(df_clusters['algoType'], df_clusters['sizeBucket'])

→ Do certain algos dominate large-order buckets?
→ Are specific venues used for passive vs aggressive clusters?


---

🔹 3. Statistical validation — “Is what I see significant?”

Once you have features, you can formalise patterns.

A. Cluster quality metrics

Compute silhouette / DB index per bucket or per side and test:

df_clusters.groupby(['dealSide','sizeBucket']).apply(lambda g: silhouette_score(...))

→ Are BUY bursts more coherent than SELL?

B. Stability tests

Re-run ST-DBSCAN with slightly varied eps_space and measure adjusted Rand index (ARI) between labelings to test robustness.

C. Correlation analysis

Correlate cluster size or duration with market volatility, spread, or volume (if you have them).


---

🔹 4. Visual storytelling / diagnostics

Great plots that make clusters intuitive to others:

Time–price scatter: colour by cluster → shows temporal overlap.

Cluster timeline chart: one bar per cluster on a timeline → bursts visible.

Heatmap of cluster frequency vs time of day × side.

Impact–duration plot: see trade-offs between stealth and speed.



---

🔹 5. Optional advanced directions

If you want to take it to research-paper level:

Idea	Description

Meta-clustering of cluster metrics	Cluster your clusters by their behavioural stats (e.g., DBSCAN → KMeans on cluster_summary).
Sequence modelling	Model inter-cluster intervals or direction autocorrelation (are BUY bursts followed by SELL bursts?).
Hidden-state inference	Apply HMM to cluster start times to infer regime shifts in trader behaviour.
Cross-desk comparison	Compare voice vs e-trader clusters: sizes, durations, aggressiveness metrics.



---

🧩 If You’re Unsure Where to Start Next

Here’s a concrete 3-day roadmap to move forward meaningfully:

Day	Goal	Deliverable

1	Generate per-cluster summary table (duration, total qty, fill%, side, etc.)	CSV / dataframe summary
2	Visualise cluster features (duration vs total qty, side vs time-of-day)	2-3 matplotlib plots
3	Add evaluation metrics (silhouette / DB), interpret by bucket	table of scores + short textual interpretation


Once that’s done, we can go into impact modelling or behaviour archetype identification.


---

Would you like me to generate a ready-to-paste code block that:

1. Builds the cluster summary table,


2. Calculates silhouette & DB scores per bucket and side,


3. Plots a few interpretable visuals (duration vs total qty, impact vs size)?
