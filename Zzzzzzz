Excellent ‚Äî this is exactly the point where most people move from ‚ÄúI can make the HMM run‚Äù to ‚ÄúI actually understand what it‚Äôs telling me.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs slow down and explain everything ‚Äî both the math concepts and what you‚Äôre seeing in the plots ‚Äî and then I‚Äôll give you the fixed code for the slippage bar plots you described.

üß† 1. Why you get ‚Äúdegenerate solution‚Äù when you only have 5 clusters

Let‚Äôs recall the core idea.

A Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) tries to estimate:

1. Transition probabilities between latent states (regimes)


2. Emission distributions (the Gaussian parameters for each state)



Each state is described by:

Mean vector Œº‚Çñ (dimension d)

Covariance matrix Œ£‚Çñ (d√ód if full, or d if diagonal, or 1 if spherical)


If you have only 5 data points (clusters) but try to fit, say,
K = 2 states √ó 4 features (d = 4),
then you‚Äôre trying to estimate ‚âà 19 parameters from 5 data points ‚Äî the model literally has more unknowns than observations, so it cannot fit; the covariance matrices become singular (division by zero inside).
That‚Äôs what hmmlearn is warning about.

When you have more clusters (say 30+), there are enough data to estimate those means and variances sensibly.

So, in short:

Symptom	Meaning	Fix

‚ÄúFree scalars > data points‚Äù	Too few clusters to estimate K √ó d parameters	reduce K, reduce d, or use spherical covariance
‚ÄúDivision by zero at K=1‚Äù	HMM with 1 state ‚áí no transitions; log-likelihood normalization breaks	if N < 6, don‚Äôt run HMM ‚Äî it‚Äôs just not enough data



---

üß© 2. What the covariance type means

Type	Meaning	# of variance parameters	When to use

'full'	each state has full Œ£‚Çñ (all correlations)	K √ó d(d+1)/2	large data only
'diag'	each state has diagonal Œ£‚Çñ (independent features)	K √ó d	moderate data
'spherical'	each state has single variance œÉ‚Çñ¬≤ I	K	small data, very stable


So when your data are small, spherical is safest ‚Äî it says ‚Äúeach state has a mean vector but same shape in all feature directions.‚Äù
That‚Äôs what our version uses by default.


---

üîÑ 3. Transition matrix vs covariance matrix

These are completely different things:

Matrix	Size	Meaning

Transition matrix (transmat_)	K√óK	Probability of going from state i ‚Üí j between consecutive observations
Covariance matrix (covars_)	depends on covariance type	Spread (variance) of each Gaussian emission per state


We fixed the transition matrix so it‚Äôs valid even if you have short sequences:

T = np.full((K,K), (1-0.85)/(K-1))
np.fill_diagonal(T, 0.85)

That means:
Each state has an 85 % chance to stay where it is, and 15 % chance to switch.


---

üìä 4. Interpreting your plots

(a) Z-score bar chart (state means plot)

Each bar height shows how that feature behaves relative to its overall mean, per hidden state.

Example (scaled):

Feature	State 0	State 1

log_total_qty	‚àí1.2	+0.8
log_duration_s	+0.4	‚àí0.5
tempo	+1.1	‚àí0.7


Interpretation:

State 0 ‚Üí smaller total qty, longer duration, slower tempo ‚Üí passive regime

State 1 ‚Üí larger total qty, shorter duration, faster tempo ‚Üí aggressive burst regime


That‚Äôs why the plot title says ‚ÄúZ-score‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs normalized (mean 0, sd 1) scale, so +2 = ‚Äúwell above average,‚Äù ‚àí2 = ‚Äúwell below average.‚Äù


---

(b) Box plot of duration per regime

Each box summarizes how long clusters last under each hidden regime.

If regime 1 has very small durations ‚Üí that‚Äôs a ‚Äúburst‚Äù state.

If regime 0 has long durations ‚Üí that‚Äôs a ‚Äústeady/passive‚Äù state.



---

(c) Timeline scatter (regime through time)

Each cluster (dot) is colored by the regime it was assigned.
You see how the trader flips between ‚Äúmodes‚Äù ‚Äî e.g., bursts in the morning, quieter in the afternoon.


---

üß≠ 5. What regimes mean in practice

The HMM assigns each cluster (each point in time) to one hidden state/regime.

Think of it as latent trading behavior mode.
For example:

Regime	Typical traits (from means/plots)	Possible interpretation

0	long duration, small qty, low tempo	passive participation / ‚Äúrest‚Äù phase
1	short duration, large qty, high tempo, wide price span	aggressive execution burst
2	intermediate quantities	steady voice flow


So each ‚Äúregime‚Äù is a consistent pattern in the multi-feature space, and the HMM also models how likely you are to switch between them.

üìâ 6. Slippage bar plots (your requested layout)

You said:

> ‚Äú3 separate plots ‚Äî each has slippage on y-axis, gross executed on x-axis, and bars for each size bucket.‚Äù



Here‚Äôs exactly that:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def plot_slippages_by_bucket(df, size_col='sizeBucket',
                             qty_col='grossExecuted',
                             slippage_cols=('mid_slippage','sec_impact','mid_fillpx')):
    """
    Makes 3 side-by-side barplots:
      X-axis = grossExecuted (binned or mean per bucket)
      Y-axis = each slippage metric
      Hue = size bucket
    """
    df = df.copy()
    # ensure numeric
    df[qty_col] = pd.to_numeric(df[qty_col], errors='coerce')
    for c in slippage_cols:
        df[c] = pd.to_numeric(df[c], errors='coerce')

    # aggregate mean slippage per bucket
    agg = (df.groupby(size_col)
             .agg({qty_col:'mean', **{c:'mean' for c in slippage_cols}})
             .reset_index())

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12, 4), sharex=False)
    for ax, col in zip(axes, slippage_cols):
        sns.barplot(data=agg, x=qty_col, y=col, hue=size_col, ax=ax)
        ax.set_xlabel('Gross Executed (mean per bucket)')
        ax.set_ylabel(col)
        ax.set_title(f'{col} vs Gross Executed')
        ax.legend(title='Size Bucket', loc='best')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

Use it like:

plot_slippages_by_bucket(st_outliers,
    size_col='sizeBucket',
    qty_col='grossExecuted',
    slippage_cols=('mid_slippage','sec_impact','mid_fillpx'))

This will give you three bar charts:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Immediate (mid_slippage)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Secondary (sec_impact)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Mid-fill (mid_fillpx)


Each bar color = size bucket, so you can compare impact across order sizes.

üß© 7. Quick mental checklist

‚úÖ Enough clusters (‚â• 8 √ó K √ó d) before fitting HMM
‚úÖ Covariance = ‚Äúspherical‚Äù for stability when N small
‚úÖ Fix transition matrix to avoid zeros
‚úÖ Z-score plot ‚Üí how features differ per regime
‚úÖ Box plot ‚Üí duration distribution per regime
‚úÖ Timeline scatter ‚Üí when regimes appear
‚úÖ Slippage bars ‚Üí impact vs size bucket


---

If you show me:

print(len(df_clusters['cluster'].unique()))
print(df_clusters['sizeBucket'].value_counts())

I can tell you exactly what K and covariance are viable and which features will be dropped automatically for your dataset size.
