Great — venue names and other categorical (non-spatial) features are very useful, but they need careful encoding before you feed them into a spatial distance (ST-DBSCAN) routine. Below I’ll:

1. explain the main options in plain language and pros/cons,


2. show two practical implementations you can copy-paste (a) binary same/different (cheap & robust) and (b) one-hot → dimension-reduce (SVD) (scales to many venues), and


3. show how to mix categorical distance with numeric distance and tune a weight so the DBSCAN neighbors function respects venue similarity.



No questions — I’ll give code you can drop into your notebook and short recommendations for which to pick.

Quick overview (plain English)

Binary same/different: treat venues as either the same (distance 0) or different (distance 1). Very robust; cheap; good when the main question is “same venue or not”.

Frequency / ordinal encoding: replace venue name with its count or rank. Simple, but can be misleading (does count imply similarity?).

One-hot encoding: convert each venue to an indicator vector. Accurate but creates high dimensional sparse vectors (makes Euclidean distances weird).

One-hot → SVD / PCA (dense embedding): take the sparse one-hot matrix, compress it to a small dense vector per venue. Keeps relative structure and is good for many venues.

Target / mean encoding (e.g. mean slippage per venue): replace venues with the average of a target variable. Powerful but leaks if used incorrectly — only use with proper cross-validation or for exploratory analysis.

Learned embeddings: train an embedding (e.g. via a small NN) based on predictive task — more work but flexible.

Gower / mixed distance: combine categorical distance (0/1 or encoded) with numeric distances; you must choose a weight to balance types.


In practice:

If venue count < ~20 → one-hot + optional PCA is fine.

If venue count is large → frequency or one-hot→SVD (TruncatedSVD) is preferred.

If you care about leakage from past outcomes (slippage), avoid target encoding unless you do CV.

Method A — cheap & robust: binary same/different (recommended first try)

Idea: when computing distance, add w_venue * (venue != center_venue) as an extra squared term.

Advantages: simple, fast, interpretable (either same venue or not). Great when you expect events at the same venue to cluster.

Drop this into your neighbors function.

def neighbors_with_venue_binary(df_day, obj_idx, eps1, eps2_minutes, time_col='startTime', venue_col='venue', w_venue=0.5):
    """
    w_venue is the (scaled) penalty for being at a different venue (tune it).
    """
    center = df_day.loc[obj_idx]
    t0 = center[time_col]
    if pd.isna(t0):
        return []
    min_time = t0 - pd.Timedelta(minutes=eps2_minutes)
    max_time = t0 + pd.Timedelta(minutes=eps2_minutes)
    cand = df_day[(df_day[time_col] >= min_time) & (df_day[time_col] <= max_time)]
    if cand.shape[0] == 0:
        return []
    # numeric distances (example using f_qty and f_price)
    dq = (cand['f_qty'].to_numpy() - center['f_qty'])**2
    dp = (cand['f_price'].to_numpy() - center['f_price'])**2
    # categorical venue distance: 0 if same, 1 if different
    if venue_col in df_day.columns:
        venue_diff = (cand[venue_col].to_numpy() != center[venue_col]).astype(float)
    else:
        venue_diff = np.zeros(len(cand))
    # combined distance: sqrt(dq + dp + (w_venue * venue_diff)**2)
    dist = np.sqrt(dq + dp + (w_venue * venue_diff)**2)
    mask = (dist <= eps1)
    mask &= (cand.index.to_numpy() != obj_idx)
    return list(cand.index.to_numpy()[mask])

Tune: start with w_venue=0.5 and eps1 ~ 0.5–1.0 (same units as numeric scaled features). Increase w_venue if you want DBSCAN to prefer same-venue points (i.e., treat different venues as far away).

Method B — one-hot → TruncatedSVD (dense low-dim venue vectors)

When you have many venues or want more nuanced similarity between venues (e.g., venues that often behave similarly), compress one-hot to a small numeric embedding. Then concatenate embeddings with numeric features and run DBSCAN on combined space.

Steps:

1. OneHot encode venues to sparse matrix.


2. Run TruncatedSVD to get k dense dimensions per venue.


3. Join the k dims to your scaled numeric features.


4. Use the usual Euclidean distance over the full vector.



Code (requires sklearn):

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, RobustScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD

def encode_venue_onehot_svd(df, venue_col='venue', n_components=6, min_freq=1):
    """
    Returns an (N, n_components) numpy array with dense embeddings for venue.
    - filters out very rare venues if you want (min_freq)
    """
    venues = df[venue_col].fillna('<<MISSING>>').astype(str).values.reshape(-1,1)
    # optionally, group rare venues -> 'RARE'
    if min_freq > 1:
        vc = pd.Series(venues.ravel()).value_counts()
        rare = set(vc[vc < min_freq].index)
        venues = np.array([("RARE" if v in rare else v) for v in venues.ravel()]).reshape(-1,1)

    enc = OneHotEncoder(sparse=True, handle_unknown='infrequent_if_exist')  # fallback: for older sklearn use handle_unknown='ignore'
    X_sparse = enc.fit_transform(venues)   # shape (N, n_unique_venues)

    # reduce dimensions
    svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=min(n_components, X_sparse.shape[1]-1 if X_sparse.shape[1]>1 else 1), random_state=42)
    X_dense = svd.fit_transform(X_sparse)  # shape (N, n_components)
    return X_dense, enc, svd

def add_features_with_venue_svd(df, qty_col='grossOrdered', price_col='priceExecuted', venue_col='venue',
                                venue_components=6, w_qty=1.0, w_price=1.0):
    # numeric features (scale)
    df2 = df.copy()
    qty = pd.to_numeric(df2[qty_col], errors='coerce').fillna(0.0).to_numpy()
    price = pd.to_numeric(df2[price_col], errors='coerce').fillna(0.0).to_numpy()
    numeric = np.column_stack([qty, price])
    scaler = RobustScaler()
    numeric_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(numeric)
    # encode venue
    X_venue, enc, svd = encode_venue_onehot_svd(df2, venue_col=venue_col, n_components=venue_components)
    # apply per-feature weights if desired: multiply numeric columns; also scale venue dims to comparable scale
    numeric_scaled[:,0] *= w_qty
    numeric_scaled[:,1] *= w_price
    # scale venue axes to roughly same scale as numeric (optionally)
    # simple normalization: divide by median absolute deviation of numeric and venue dims
    # concatenate
    X_full = np.hstack([numeric_scaled, X_venue])
    # attach back to df for inspection
    for i in range(X_full.shape[1]):
        df2[f'feat_{i}'] = X_full[:, i]
    # also attach f_qty/f_price convenience names (first two)
    df2['f_qty'] = X_full[:,0]
    df2['f_price'] = X_full[:,1]
    return df2, enc, svd, scaler

How to use: call add_features_with_venue_svd to get df2 with f_qty, f_price, and extra compressed venue dims. Then use your standard neighbors which computes Euclidean distance on f_qty,f_price — modify it to use all feat_* columns (or pass X_full as the array used for distances).

Example neighbors using full vector:

def neighbors_full_vector(df_day, obj_idx, eps1, eps2_minutes, time_col='startTime', feature_cols=None):
    center = df_day.loc[obj_idx]
    t0 = center[time_col]
    if pd.isna(t0):
        return []
    min_time = t0 - pd.Timedelta(minutes=eps2_minutes)
    max_time = t0 + pd.Timedelta(minutes=eps2_minutes)
    cand = df_day[(df_day[time_col] >= min_time) & (df_day[time_col] <= max_time)]
    if cand.shape[0] == 0:
        return []
    if feature_cols is None:
        # automatically use any column that starts with 'feat_' we created earlier
        feature_cols = [c for c in df_day.columns if c.startswith('feat_')]
    center_vec = center[feature_cols].to_numpy().astype(float)
    cand_mat = cand[feature_cols].to_numpy().astype(float)
    diffs = cand_mat - center_vec[None, :]
    dist = np.sqrt(np.sum(diffs**2, axis=1))
    mask = (dist <= eps1) & (cand.index.to_numpy() != obj_idx)
    return list(cand.index.to_numpy()[mask])

Tune: n_components (try 3–10), possibly scale down SVD dims if they dominate numeric axes (use RobustScaler on combined matrix).

Example: combine both approaches (binary + SVD)

If you want both “same venue is special” and similarity between venues modeled by SVD, you can:

Use SVD embeddings for general venue similarity.

Add an extra binary “same venue” dimension (0/1) with its own weight to strongly prefer same-venue neighbors.


When building X_full, append is_same_venue column set to 0/1 (but that depends on center — easier to implement in neighbors function as delta).


---

How to choose weights and eps

After encoding, compute the scale (MAD or std) of numeric features and venue features; pick w_venue so that w_venue * venue_component_scale is roughly comparable to numeric distances you care about.

Practical heuristic: run a small grid:

eps1 from 0.3 → 1.5 (if features are RobustScaled).

w_venue from 0.0 → 2.0.
Visual checks: use feature-space plot and time plot to verify clusters look sensible.


If a venue dimension is dominating clusters (too many clusters split by venue), reduce its scaling.



---

When to use target/mean encoding (slippage) — CAUTION

If you want to encode venue by historical slippage (e.g., venue A historically worse), that’s target encoding. It’s powerful but leaks: you must compute encodings out-of-sample when testing. Only use for final models or exploratory analysis (not to define clusters that you will then evaluate on the same data).

If you want to see whether venues with similar slippage group together, you can compute venue_mean_slippage on a rolling or earlier period and use that as a numeric feature.


---

Diagnostics to run after encoding

1. df['venue'].nunique() — how many venues? choose method accordingly.


2. Inspect SVD variance: svd.explained_variance_ratio_.sum() — how much venue variation captured by n_components.


3. Plot first two venue components vs numeric features to make sure they’re not dominating.


4. Run k-distance elbow on the combined features to pick eps1.




---

Final short cookbook (what I would try, in order)

1. Start simple: binary same/different; set w_venue=0.5; run ST-DBSCAN. Inspect time plot.


2. If too coarse/you have many venues: do one-hot→SVD (n=6), concatenate with numeric features, run standard ST-DBSCAN on combined vector.


3. If you want to capture venue quality (slippage) use mean encoding but only computed from a non-overlapping history window.


4. Tune eps1, eps2, w_venue visually (feature and time plots).




---

If you want, I’ll:

paste a ready-to-run full example that starts from your original DataFrame (startTime, grossOrdered, priceExecuted, orderSide, venue), builds SVD encodings, runs ST-DBSCAN and plots time and feature space colourised by cluster — adapted to your column names.


Say “yes” and I’ll output that full runnable cell right away.
