Good question. Short answer: you use K = 2 as a conservative, interpretable starting point when BIC (or formal model selection) is unreliable or you lack data. But you should decide intentionally — not arbitrarily — using a combination of parsimony, data limits, stability checks, domain knowledge, and diagnostics. Below I’ll explain the full reasoning and give practical, ready-to-run code to compare and pick K when you’re not relying on BIC alone.


---

Why start with K = 2 when you stop using BIC

1. Parsimony — fewer parameters → less chance of degeneracy when data are limited. K=2 captures a basic dichotomy (e.g. “aggressive vs passive”) that is often meaningful in execution analytics.


2. Data budget — HMM parameter count grows with K and feature dimension d; if N (number of clusters) is small, the simplest nontrivial HMM is K=2.


3. Interpretability — two regimes are easy to inspect and explain to stakeholders.


4. Bootstrap approach — start with K=2, inspect state means and transitions. Only increase K if there is stable, interpretable evidence for more regimes.

Principled alternatives to BIC (what to use instead)

If you don’t or can’t rely on BIC, use one or more of the following, in order of practicality:

Held-out log-likelihood (blocked cross-validation) — fit on part of the sequences, score on held-out sequences (best if you have multiple independent sequences e.g., days or buckets).

Likelihood elbow — plot training log-likelihood vs K; pick K where logL gains diminish.

Stability / robustness — fit the model multiple times (different inits / bootstrap samples) and compute similarity (Adjusted Rand Index) between state assignments. Prefer K with stable labelling.

Interpretability & separation — check state means (Z-scores) and state occupancy; require each state to have nontrivial occupancy and distinct means.

Practical rule-of-thumb — require parameter budget: . If violated, reduce K or d.

Predictive / downstream utility — test whether regimes improve a downstream task (e.g., predict cluster impact).

Concrete workflow (no BIC) — code + explanations

Paste and run the functions below. They:

fit HMMs for K in a candidate range,

compute training log-likelihood,

perform blocked holdout scoring (if you can split into sequences),

compute stability (ARI across multiple initializations),

surface diagnostics (state occupancy, transition diagonals, state means).


Assumes you have cluster_summary (one row per cluster), already prepared and standardized features in X (N×d) and optionally lengths (sequence lengths).

How to use

1. Prepare X (standardized features matrix) and lengths if you have sequence blocks (otherwise pass lengths=None and ensure X is time-ordered).


2. Run:



df_diag = compare_K_candidates(X, lengths=lengths, K_candidates=[2,3,4], cov_types=['spherical','diag'])
print(df_diag)

3. Inspect:

prefer models with higher test_ll (generalization).

prefer high stability_ari (labels reproducible).

discard models that produce tiny state occupancy (states used < ~3–5% of data).

avoid models with trans_diag near 1 for all states (no switching) unless you believe regimes are extremely sticky.





---

Practical decision rules from these diagnostics

If test_ll improves substantially going from K=2 → K=3 and stability_ari remains high, consider K=3.

If test_ll does not improve or stability drops, keep K=2.

If some states have occupancy < 0.03 (3%) or trans_diag entries are pathological (rows of zeros or near-identity), that K is probably overfitting or underpowered.

If N is small (< ~30), prefer spherical covariance and K=2.

If you want interpretability and K=2 yields meaningful, separable state means (use the state-means plot), use K=2.



---

How to interpret the chosen model (once you pick K)

1. State means (transform back from scaled space if needed): show typical feature signature per regime.


2. State occupancy: fraction of clusters in each regime (helps name regimes).


3. Transition matrix: how persistent each regime is and how frequently switching occurs.


4. Posterior probabilities: you can compute model.predict_proba(X) (or model.predict_proba-like via model._compute_log_likelihood) and inspect how certain the assignment is. Low certainty means the regime boundary is fuzzy.


5. Downstream verification: test if regime labels separate slippage, impact, or other economically meaningful outcomes.




---

Final recommendation (practical, immediate)

If your N is small or you saw degeneracy earlier, use K = 2 and cov='spherical' until you gather more clusters or aggregate sequences. K=2 is the most defensible default.

If you have moderate N (> ~50) run the compare_K_candidates set above with K in {2,3,4} and use test log-likelihood + stability_ari + occupancy to choose K.

If you choose a larger K, validate that every state has interpretable means and nontrivial occupancy.



---

If you want, paste X.shape, d, N, and a short cluster_summary[used_cols].describe() and I will:

run through the diagnostics mentally and recommend the maximum safe K for your dataset, and

if you want, produce the exact small code block to run (with the right defaults) on your dataset.
